Each instrument plays a unique role in accompanying the vocalist or instrumentalist and providing rhythmic and melodic support.
    <br />
    <b>Compositions:</b> Carnatic Music includes a vast repertoire of compositions, ranging from ancient devotional hymns known as Varnams and Kritis to more contemporary compositions composed by renowned composers such as Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Syama Sastri. These compositions are typically performed in concerts and recitals, where they are often improvised upon and embellished by the performers.
